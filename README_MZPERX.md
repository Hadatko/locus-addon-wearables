#MZPERX's comment
I Forked this addon Because I would like to Improve it for my usage.
My usage is to follow a pre uploaded track and check the measured values like avg speed, distance, elevation gain.
I have a rectangle faced Samsung Gear Live watch where I can test the modifications. After a modification I do not have time to test everithing I test only what I use.

##This is why there is no guarantee that after a modification everything will work as before.
