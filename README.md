# Locus Map - add-on Wearables Mzperx's fork

This addon is a fork of the original Locus Map - add-on Wearables. Many thanks to Asamm Software and Menion for providing it to open source!

The purpose of this fork to add functionalities what I would like to see when I use the watch for my workouts and my outdoor activities.
I develop it for fun and when I have time.

### My usage scenarios are: short-run (about 1 hour), long run (3-5 hours), hiking and cycling (< 8 hours). Usually I wear hr belt.

My exceptations for short-run:
always-on screen, show hr, show statistical data like avg speed, distance etc...

My expectation for long-run and for other long lasting activities:
consume less battery,
see the battery level of the watch and phone,
aler if I left the pre-selected route,
map where I can zoom in/out.

What functionalities what I have added so far:
- when track recoding is running there are 3 different screens: 
-- screen1: time elapsed, average speed, distance, cummulative altitude.
-- screen2: actual hr, avg hr, max hr,
-- screen3: control buttons (stop, pause, add waypoint) and the battery levels of the watch and the phone.
- Zooming function for the map screen: the screen are divided to three zones (top, middle, bottom) if you tap on a zone it will select a different zoom level (18,19,20).
- Ambient mode: when the watch is ambient mode all data will be sinchronized rarely to save battery. If the screen is the map view screen it goes to black when it is in ambient mode.
